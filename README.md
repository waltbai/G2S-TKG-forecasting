## Usage
To be described.

## Plan
- [ ] Small-scale Preliminary Experiments
  - [ ] Preprocess (2024.4.1~2024.4.7)
    - [x] TKG data loader
    - [x] Find history method
    - [x] Construct prompt
      - [x] Anonymous methods
      - [ ] remain some problems, need to run original code
    - [ ] LLM tokenization and indexing
  - [ ] Data (2024.4.1~2024.4.7)
  - [ ] Model
